# Clever Infinite Scroll
This is another Infinite Scroll jQuery plugin but little bit clever.
* I haven't tested it properly yet
* Please implement it in page footer or something common element
* It is super simple, it might work in Wordpress or other CMSs

## Features
* Infinite Scroll
  * Only you need a few elements to make it active
  * You can customize the selector names
  * Of course, contents are loaded by Ajax
* Change URL
  * The URL and page title will be changed automatically
  * It leaves History that which contents you have seen in your browser
  * It will work for both scrolling up & down

That's it. Pretty simple, Eh?
